            <p class="lead">Say you are writing designing a website with a team. You all have separate computers and separate ideas that keep changing so new versions of the website keep being made.  You could save each separate file, name it a different thing and have dozens, if not hundreds, of files clogging up your hard-drive, or you could use a versioning control system. This brilliant tool serves as one main repository for all of your project files. Everything is stored in one place and your group members can work on the project at the same time. This system also tells you who changed the files and when, as well as the changes that were made. If you need to go back to an old file because you need to check something, it allows you to do so and it backs up your files automatically so you do not run the risk of losing your project and having to start over. This is a brilliant and convenient tool that everyone needs to learn how to use if they want to do anything in programming.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">So now we know what a version control system is, but where can you find one? A great (and free) website is Git. This specific type of website is a Distributed Version Control system. Every person on the website has their own copy of the data and the website will prevent accidental overwrites on the shared files. In a DVCS, clients mirror a repository completely, which prevents data lose in the case of the serving dying. If any of the systems were working on the data when the server died then one of the repositories can be backed up to the server and that will fully restore it. This is a great function due to the fact that technology can be fickle and no one wants to lose his or her hard work. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">There are a few basic commands of Git: git init, which creates a new local repository; git add –all, which adds the files and folders from their current place to the staging area; git commit –am ‘initial commit’, which commit changes to the files to the local repository; git log, which shows all the backups in the repository and git status, which shows all the files that had been changed and which ones had been added to the staging area. There are also a few remote commands: git remote, git pull, which pulls the changes in a remote repository to a local repository and git push, which pushes the changes in the local repository to the remote repository.

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git has not always been here, ready to serve our versioning control needs. The Git we know today started out because the open source software Linus kernel began using a proprietary DVCS named BitKeeper. However, within a few years, the relationship between the Linux kernel community and the company that created BitKeeper crumpled and Linux kernel was no longer allowed to use BitKeeper for free. This then allowed for the Linux kernel community to work their own better and faster tool using the skills they gained by using BitKeeper. Thus, Git was born. Since it’s conception in 2005, this system has evolved to be easier, faster and more efficient while still retaining it’s original concepts.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The word “repository” has been thrown around in the last two paragraphs, but what exactly is a repository? A repository is a location where data can be stored. In a version control system, there are two types of repositories: a remote one and a local one. A remote repository is a repository that sits on a remote server and allows multiple team members to look at it and edit it. A local repository is a repository that sits on a local machine of one person. There are two ways to create a local repository, one is by duplicating an existing remote repository onto your computer and the other is just by making a new repository altogether. A repository is a very useful tool for storing files in one versioning control system.
